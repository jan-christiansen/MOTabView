Features
--------

The property `addingStyle` of a tab view can be used to set how a new
tab is added. If the property is set to `MOTabViewAddingAtLastIndex` a
new tab is added at the right end of the tabs, which resembles the
behavior of safari prior to iOS6. If the property is set
`MOTabViewAddingAtNextIndex` a new tab is added to the right of the
current tab. This behaviour resembles safari in iOS6.


Usage
-----

Import the static library as a sub-project into your main project.
